# Conditional Rendering React App

## Overview
This is a React application demonstrating conditional rendering, allowing users to add and manage a list of users with names and emails. The app persists data in local storage and uses conditional rendering to display either an empty state or a user list based on the data.

## Features
- Add users with a name and email via a form.
- Display a list of users with the option to delete individual entries.
- Persist user data using local storage across page refreshes.
- Conditionally render an empty state or user list based on the number of users.
- Responsive design with basic CSS styling.

## Technologies Used
- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **React Hooks**: Uses `useState` for state management and `useEffect` for side effects (local storage).
- **JavaScript (ES6)**: For logic and event handling.
- **HTML/CSS**: Basic structure with an external `App.css` file for styling.
